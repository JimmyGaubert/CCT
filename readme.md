### How it works?

This app uses [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and its included [fs](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v16.x/docs/api/fs.html) library to find and read Crossout logs,

then the [@iamtraction/google-translate](https://github.com/iamtraction/google-translate) library to translate these messages, using the google's api. 

Then it just outpout the translations to the windows terminal ^^

The application does not modify any game files... Great, right?


### Easy to use!
We wondered how to make the use of the tool easy. Instead of giving you a list of commands to type, we've created two .bat files that do it for you. No dev or admin skills are required to use it.


### Installation :

1- Download this repo and place it where you want.

2- Run the Install_NodeJS.bat file to install Node.js.

3- Once it is installed, run the Crossout_Chat_Translator.bat file

4- Enjoy!
